Navigate to a specific TOGAF ADM phase for the active engagement.

## Instructions

1. If no engagement is active in context, run the `/ea-open` flow first.

2. If a phase argument was provided, map it to the full phase name:
   - `Prelim` → Preliminary
   - `Req` or `Requirements` → Architecture Requirements
   - `A` → Architecture Vision
   - `B` → Business Architecture
   - `C` → prompt: Data Architecture or Application Architecture?
   - `C-Data` → Data/Information Architecture
   - `C-App` → Application Architecture
   - `D` → Technology Architecture
   - `E` → Opportunities & Solutions
   - `F` → Migration Planning
   - `G` → Implementation Governance
   - `H` → Architecture Change Management

   If no argument provided, display the phase picklist:
   ```
   Select an ADM phase:
   1. Preliminary         [✅ Complete]
   2. Requirements        [✅ Complete]
   3. Phase A — Vision    [🔄 In Progress]
   4. Phase B — Business  [⬜ Not Started]
   ...
   ```

3. Load the selected phase:
   - Update `currentPhase` in `engagement.json`
   - If phase status is `Not Started`, set to `In Progress` and record `startedAt`
   - If phase status is `Complete`, ask: "This phase is marked complete. Would you like to reopen it for editing?"

4. Display a phase summary:
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Phase A — Architecture Vision
   Engagement: Acme Retail Transformation
   Status: In Progress (started 2026-03-01)
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════

   Required artifacts:
   ✅ Architecture Principles (Approved)
   🔄 Architecture Vision (Draft — interview in progress)
   ⬜ Statement of Architecture Work (not started)
   ⬜ Stakeholder Map (not started)

   Required inputs from previous phases:
   ✅ Organisation Model (from Prelim)
   ✅ Requirements Register (from Requirements phase)
   ```

5. Offer next actions:
   - Create a missing artifact → `/ea-artifact create [artifact-name]`
   - Continue an in-progress artifact interview → `/ea-interview resume`
   - View phase guidance → loads the `ea-engagement-lifecycle` skill and use the `ea-facilitator` agent
   - Mark phase complete → verify all required artifacts exist first

6. When marking a phase complete:
   - Check all required artifacts for the phase exist in `artifacts/`
   - Warn if any artifacts are still in `Draft` status
   - Set phase `status` to `Complete` and `completedAt` timestamp
   - Update `lastModified` in `engagement.json`
   - Suggest the next recommended phase
