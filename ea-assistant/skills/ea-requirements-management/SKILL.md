description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "manage architecture requirements", "add a requirement", "sync requirements from the repo", "view requirements", "trace a requirement to an artifact", "update the requirements register", or "start the architecture requirements phase". Handles the full requirements lifecycle from capture through traceability and sync with a shared requirements repository.

# EA Requirements Management

Architecture Requirements Management is a continuous phase in the TOGAF ADM. This skill handles capturing, classifying, tracing, and syncing requirements across an EA engagement.

## Requirements Storage

Local requirements are stored in `EA-projects/{slug}/requirements/`:

```
requirements/
├── requirements.md           # human-readable requirements register
└── requirements-index.json   # machine-readable index for traceability
```

The `requirementsRepoPath` in `engagement.json` points to a shared folder (currently a file system path; SharePoint integration planned).

## Requirements Register Format

`requirements.md` uses a structured template:

```markdown
# Architecture Requirements Register
<!-- GUIDANCE: This register captures all architecture requirements for the engagement.
     Each requirement should be traceable to a driver, goal, or business need.
     Guidance text is marked with HTML comments and is NOT part of the deliverable. -->

**Engagement:** {{engagement_name}}
**Last Synced:** {{last_sync_date}}
**Version:** {{version}}

## requirements-index.json Schema

```json
{
  "lastSynced": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "repoPath": "/path/to/shared/requirements",
  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-001",
      "title": "",
      "statement": "",
      "category": "Functional | Non-Functional | Constraint | Principle | Policy | Standard | Assumption",
      "scope": "Corporate | Project",
      "status": "Draft | Approved | Deferred | Rejected | Waived",
      "priority": "High | Medium | Low",
      "phase": "A",
      "source": "",
      "linkedArtifacts": [],
      "derivedFrom": [],
      "waiverJustification": "",
      "sourceFile": "requirements.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Fields added vs. previous schema:** `statement`, `category`, `scope`, `source`, `derivedFrom`, `waiverJustification`. `Waived` added to status enum.

## Category-Specific Guidance

Each category captures different information. The `description` field stores category-specific structured metadata:

| Category | Purpose | Extra fields in `description` |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional** | Capabilities the architecture must provide | Plain text description |
| **Non-Functional** | Quality attributes (performance, availability, security) | Plain text description |
| **Constraint** | Fixed limits — budget, technology, regulatory — that restrict design choices | Plain text description |
| **Principle** | Normative design statement governing all decisions | `Rationale: … \n\n Implications: …` |
| **Policy** | Organisation-wide rules that architecture must comply with | `Owner: … / Effective: … / Enforcement: Mandatory\|Advisory` |
| **Standard** | Prescribed technical or process standards (internal or external) | `Version: … / Domain: … / Enforcement: Mandatory\|Advisory` |
| **Assumption** | Stated beliefs about unknowns, held pending confirmation | Plain text description |

**Policy vs. Standard vs. Principle — definitions to use when classifying:**

| Term | Answers | Typical source | Example |
|------|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Policy** | *What are we required to comply with?* | Executive directive, legal, regulatory body | "All customer PII must remain within the EU" |
| **Standard** | *How must we implement it?* | Enterprise architecture team, industry body | "All APIs must conform to REST API Design Standard v2.1" |
| **Principle** | *What values guide every decision?* | Architecture Review Board, EA team | "Prefer open standards over proprietary solutions" |

When a user provides an item that could be any of these, ask a clarifying question rather than guessing. Common confusions:
- A policy with technical detail is often a standard (e.g., "must use TLS 1.3" → Standard, not Policy).
- A principle stated as a rule is often a policy (e.g., "all data must be encrypted at rest" → Policy if it has an owner/enforcer, Principle if it is a design value).

## Corporate Requirement Edit Protection

Requirements with `scope: "Corporate"` have restricted editability. The following rules apply:

**Read-only fields (content is authoritative from the shared repo):**
- `title`, `statement`, `category`, `priority`, `source`, `phase`

**Editable fields (engagement-specific state):**
- `status`, `linkedArtifacts`, `derivedFrom`, `waiverJustification`

**Waived status rules:**
- `Waived` status may only be set when `waiverJustification` is non-empty. Enforce this before writing to the index for Corporate-scoped requirements. If the field is blank, prompt: "A waiver justification is required for Corporate requirements. Please enter the justification."
- For Project-scoped requirements, `waiverJustification` is strongly recommended but not enforced.
- A re-sync must never overwrite `status`, `waiverJustification`, or `linkedArtifacts` on an existing Corporate record, even if the source has different values.

**Display:** Prefix Corporate requirement IDs with 🔒 in all list and table views to indicate read-only content.

## Backward Compatibility

When reading a `requirements-index.json` where entries are missing the `scope` field (engagements created before this version):

1. Apply a migration heuristic per entry:
   - If the entry's `sourceFile` matches a file path under `requirementsRepoPath` → infer `scope: "Corporate"`
   - Otherwise → infer `scope: "Project"`
2. Write the inferred `scope` values on the next write operation (lazy, one-time migration — do not trigger a separate write just for migration)
3. When unscoped records are detected, display a banner:
   > "Note: X requirements are missing scope classification. Inferred scope has been applied — run `/ea-requirements list` to review."

### Scope Reclassification on Re-sync

If a Project-scoped record matches an incoming Corporate record on re-sync (same ID, incoming `scope` is Corporate):
- Flag as a scope reclassification conflict
- Prompt: "REQ-XXX was Project-scoped and is now Corporate in the shared repo. Confirming will make its content fields read-only. Confirm reclassification?"
- Only reclassify on explicit user confirmation

## Syncing from the Requirements Repository

The requirements repository may contain mixed formats: Markdown, Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx/.csv).

### Sync Workflow

1. Read `requirementsRepoPath` from `engagement.json`
2. Scan the directory for supported files: `.md`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`
3. For each file, extract requirements using the `ea-document-ingestion` skill
4. Present extracted requirements to the user for review and confirmation
5. Merge approved requirements into `requirements.md` and `requirements-index.json`. Set `scope: "Corporate"` on all sync-imported records. Never overwrite `status`, `linkedArtifacts`, or `waiverJustification` of existing Corporate records during re-sync.
6. Update `lastSynced` timestamp
7. Flag conflicts where a repo requirement differs from a locally edited version

### Conflict Resolution

When a repo requirement conflicts with a local edit:
- Show both versions side by side
- Ask the user which to keep, or whether to merge
- Never silently overwrite local changes

## Requirements Traceability

Link requirements to artifacts to ensure every requirement is addressed:

1. Each requirement in `requirements-index.json` has a `linkedArtifacts` array
2. When creating an artifact, check for unlinked requirements relevant to that phase
3. When a requirement is marked `Approved`, verify it is linked to at least one artifact
4. Use the `ea-consistency-checker` agent to audit traceability gaps

### Traceability Matrix

Generate a traceability matrix on demand:

```
| Req ID | Requirement | Phase | Architecture Vision | Biz Arch | App Arch |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| REQ-001 | ... | A | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| REQ-002 | ... | B | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
```

## Requirements Phase Workflow

The Architecture Requirements phase runs in two modes:

**Initial capture (before Phase A):**
1. Sync from requirements repo — all synced records are automatically tagged `scope: "Corporate"`
2. Conduct requirements interview using `ea-interviewer` agent
3. Classify each item (functional, non-functional, constraint, principle, policy, standard, assumption)
4. Assign Zachman cell classification
5. Set initial priority and status

**Ongoing updates (any phase):**
1. Add new requirements as they emerge from phase activities
2. Update status of existing requirements
3. Re-sync from repo if updated externally
4. Trigger consistency check when requirements change

## Content Policy

- Requirements must be sourced from stakeholder input, uploaded documents, or explicit user entry
- AI-suggested requirements must be marked: `🤖 AI Draft — Review Required`
- Never auto-approve requirements — all require user confirmation before status is set to `Approved`
